* Overall goal: accurately/fairly measure YouTube vs. Alfalfa

**  Subgoal: isolate YouTube

*** Make a local server that behaves just like YouTube

**** Make a Web server proxy all requests to YouTube
**** and responses back to client

***** Write an HTTP listener that gets the request from the browser.
***** Standalone program.

***** Write an HTTP client that fetches a resource from YouTube.
***** Standalone program.

***** Cleanups.

***** Join the two together.

**** Download all the resources that YouTube is using

**** Modify proxy so it answers requests using local resources
**** but still fetches what it was going to fetch from YouTube
**** and compares the two

**** If there are kinds of requests that are not so easy, figure
**** these out one by one.

**** IF there are some requests we can't figure out while treating
**** client as a black-box, THEN open the box.
